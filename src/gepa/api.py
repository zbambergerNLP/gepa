    """
    GEPA is an evolutionary optimizer that evolves (multiple) text components of a complex system to optimize them towards a given metric.
    GEPA can also leverage rich textual feedback obtained from the system's execution environment, evaluation,
    and the system's own execution traces to iteratively improve the system's performance.

    Concepts:
    - System: A harness that uses text components to perform a task. Each text component of the system to be optimized is a named component of the system.
    - Candidate: A mapping from component names to component text. A concrete instantiation of the system is realized by setting the text of each system component
      to the text provided by the candidate mapping.
    - `DataInst`: An (uninterpreted) data type over which the system operates.
    - `RolloutOutput`: The output of the system on a `DataInst`.

    Each execution of the system produces a `RolloutOutput`, which can be evaluated to produce a score. The execution of the system also produces a trajectory,
    which consists of the operations performed by different components of the system, including the text of the components that were executed.

    GEPA can be applied to optimize any system that uses text components (e.g., prompts in a AI system, code snippets/code files/functions/classes in a codebase, etc.).
    In order for GEPA to plug into your system's environment, GEPA requires an adapter, `GEPAAdapter` to be implemented. The adapter is responsible for:
    1. Evaluating a proposed candidate on a batch of inputs.
       - The adapter receives a candidate proposed by GEPA, along with a batch of inputs selected from the training/validation set.
       - The adapter instantiates the system with the texts proposed in the candidate.
       - The adapter then evaluates the candidate on the batch of inputs, and returns the scores.
       - The adapter should also capture relevant information from the execution of the candidate, like system and evaluation traces.
    2. Identifying textual information relevant to a component of the candidate
       - Given the trajectories captured during the execution of the candidate, GEPA selects a component of the candidate to update.
       - The adapter receives the candidate, the batch of inputs, and the trajectories captured during the execution of the candidate.
       - The adapter is responsible for identifying the textual information relevant to the component to update.
       - This information is used by GEPA to reflect on the performnace of the component, and propose new component texts.

    At each iteration, GEPA proposes a new candidate using one of the following strategies:
    1. Reflective mutation: GEPA proposes a new candidate by mutating the current candidate, leveraging rich textual feedback.
    2. Merge: GEPA proposes a new candidate by merging 2 candidates that are on the Pareto frontier.

    GEPA also tracks the Pareto frontier of performance achieved by different candidates on the validation set. This way, it can leverage candidates that
    work well on a subset of inputs to improve the system's performance on the entire validation set, by evolving from the Pareto frontier.

    Parameters:
    - seed_candidate: The initial candidate to start with.
    - trainset: Training data supplied as an in-memory sequence or a `DataLoader` yielding batches for reflective updates.
    - valset: Validation data source (sequence or `DataLoader`) used for tracking Pareto scores. If not provided, GEPA reuses the trainset.
    - adapter: A `GEPAAdapter` instance that implements the adapter interface. This allows GEPA to plug into your system's environment. If not provided, GEPA will use a default adapter: `gepa.adapters.default_adapter.default_adapter.DefaultAdapter`, with model defined by `task_lm`.
    - task_lm: Optional. The model to use for the task. This is only used if `adapter` is not provided, and is used to initialize the default adapter.
    - evaluator: Optional. A custom evaluator to use for evaluating the candidate program. If not provided, GEPA will use the default evaluator: `gepa.adapters.default_adapter.default_adapter.ContainsAnswerEvaluator`. Only used if `adapter` is not provided.

    # Reflection-based configuration
    - reflection_lm: A `LanguageModel` instance that is used to reflect on the performance of the candidate program.
    - sampling_strategy: Controls how many (parent, minibatch) proposal tasks are sampled per iteration. One of `SingleMutationSampling` (default; 1 parent, 1 mutation — identical to classic GEPA), `SameParentSampling(n)`, `IndependentSampling(n)`, or `PxNSampling(p, n)`, or any custom `SamplingStrategy`.
    - selection_strategy: Controls which of an iteration's improving proposals enter the candidate pool. One of `AllImprovements` (default), `BestImprovement`, or `TopKImprovements(k)`, or any custom `SelectionStrategy`.
    - reflection_strategy: Advanced: a `ReflectionLM` implementation that owns how reflective mutation calls the reflection model (e.g. stateful sessions or aggregating reflectors). Defaults to the stateless single-call reflector built from `reflection_lm`. Implementations may provide `reflect_many` for batched reflection; otherwise `reflect` is called once per task.
    - reflection_level: Ablation rung for the 3-role reflection architecture (Controller -> Manifestor -> ReAct V2), built from `reflection_lm`. 0 = free-form reflective rewrite (baseline, default); 1 = the Controller selects a document region and ReAct V2 revises it with the configured edit-tool basis; 2 = the Controller conditionally selects a region and then one operator-coupled semantic action from the curated catalog (`rephrase`, `summarize`, `reformat`, `correct`, `specialize`, `generalize`, `strengthen_requirement`, `relax_requirement`, `expand`, `add_constraint`, `remove_redundancy`, `remove_harmful_content`, or `relocate`), the Manifestor realizes that action into grounded steering, and ReAct V2 receives the steering as a real provider-appropriate chat role (developer for OpenAI, user for Claude and other providers). Each candidate branch retains a user/assistant transcript of its accepted, rejected, and dropped edit attempts for later revisions on that branch; no global history is constructed. At level 2, when `reflection_lm` is a model name, the Manifestor gets its own deterministic (temperature 0) copy of that model, as POSIT prescribes; pass a `ThreeRoleReflectionLM(manifestor_lm=...)` as `reflection_strategy` to control it otherwise. Ignored when an explicit `reflection_strategy` is supplied.
    - edit_tool_set: Edit-operation basis used by ReAct V2 (only when `reflection_level > 0`). 'minimal' = {INSERT_TEXT, DELETE_TEXT}; 'broad' = {INSERT_TEXT, DELETE_TEXT, REPLACE_TEXT, MOVE_TEXT} (default). Semantic actions are each coupled to one direct broad tool; when that tool is absent from the minimal basis, ReAct V2 composes multiple insert/delete calls before finishing. This is the atomic-versus-semantic action-depth ablation axis.
    - component_kinds: Optional map from component name to its declared document kind ('prompt' or 'skill'), selecting the section template the 3-role roles address. Unlisted components default to 'prompt'. When `reflection_level > 0`, every seed component must already be written in its kind's canonical section format (`## <Section>` headers, see `gepa.strategies.document_template`); convert free-form text once with `gepa.strategies.document_template.migrate_document`.
    - template_family: Which prompt-section schema the 3-role reflection enforces (only when `reflection_level > 0`). 'auto' (default) derives the family from the prompt consumer's model identifier (Claude -> 'anthropic', Gemini/Gemma -> 'google', GPT-5.6 -> 'openai-gpt-5.6', other GPT/o-series -> 'openai', Qwen/QwQ -> 'alibaba', anything else -> 'generic'). GEPA reads a string `task_lm`, common model-name attributes on a custom adapter, or the explicit `template_model`; without an identifier it uses 'generic'. Only providers whose official guidance prescribes prompt structure get a family — a named section skeleton (OpenAI's prompt-engineering guide, Google's Gemini template, Alibaba's six-part prompt framework) or explicit placement rules (Anthropic); Meta (Muse/Llama), xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Moonshot, and Zhipu prescribe none, so their models use 'generic'. A model line whose own guide prescribes a skeleton gets a model-specific family preferred over the provider one: 'openai-gpt-5.6' carries the GPT-5.6 family guide's eight-section structure. The family follows the *task* model — the one that consumes the optimized prompt — because its post-training rewarded its provider's prompt structure. 'generic' is the papers-grounded 7-section schema; the provider families rename and reorder the sections to match the provider's own guidance, and passing one explicitly opts out of inference. The seed candidate must be written in the resolved family's section format; if auto-inference picks a family your seed does not follow, either rewrite the seed in that format (see `gepa.strategies.document_template.TEMPLATE_FAMILIES`) or pass `template_family='generic'`. For custom schemas or new kinds, pass a `ThreeRoleReflectionLM(templates=...)` as `reflection_strategy`.
    - template_model: Optional provider/model identifier used by `template_family='auto'` when the prompt consumer is hidden behind a custom adapter or callable. If omitted, GEPA checks a string `task_lm`, then common adapter attributes (`model`, `model_name`, `student_model`, `solver_model`), and finally falls back to the generic family.
    - candidate_selection_strategy: The strategy to use for selecting the candidate to update. Supported strategies: 'pareto', 'current_best', 'epsilon_greedy'. Defaults to 'pareto'.
    - frontier_type: Strategy for tracking Pareto frontiers. 'instance' tracks per validation example, 'objective' tracks per objective metric, 'hybrid' combines both, 'cartesian' tracks per (example, objective) pair. Defaults to 'instance'.
    - skip_perfect_score: Whether to skip updating the candidate if it achieves a perfect score on the minibatch.
    - batch_sampler: Strategy for selecting training examples. Can be a [BatchSampler](src/gepa/strategies/batch_sampler.py) instance or a string for a predefined strategy from ['epoch_shuffled']. Defaults to 'epoch_shuffled', which creates an [EpochShuffledBatchSampler](src/gepa/strategies/batch_sampler.py).
    - reflection_minibatch_size: The number of examples to use for reflection in each proposal step. Defaults to 3. Only valid when batch_sampler='epoch_shuffled' (default), and is ignored otherwise.
    - perfect_score: The perfect score to achieve.
    - reflection_prompt_template: The prompt template to use for reflection. Can be either a string (applied to all components) or a dict mapping component names to their specific templates. If not provided, GEPA will use the default prompt template (see [InstructionProposalSignature](src/gepa/strategies/instruction_proposal.py)). Each prompt template must contain the following placeholders, which will be replaced with actual values: `<curr_param>` (will be replaced by the instructions/component to evolve) and `<side_info>` (replaced with the inputs, outputs, and feedback generated with current instruction). When using a dict, components without a specified template will use the default template. This will be ignored if the adapter provides its own `propose_new_texts` method.
    - custom_candidate_proposer: Optional custom function for proposing new candidates. If provided, this will be used instead of the default LLM-based reflection approach. Cannot be used if adapter provides `propose_new_texts`. Signature: `(candidate, reflective_dataset, components_to_update) -> dict[str, str]`. The proposer may optionally accept a keyword argument `metadata` (an open context dict from the reflective proposer, e.g. iteration info); it is passed only if the signature accepts it, and the plain 3-arg form remains fully supported.

    # Component selection configuration
    - module_selector: Component selection strategy. Can be a ReflectionComponentSelector instance or a string ('round_robin', 'all'). Defaults to 'round_robin'. The 'round_robin' strategy cycles through components in order. The 'all' strategy selects all components for modification in every GEPA iteration.

    # Merge-based configuration
    - use_merge: Whether to use the merge strategy.
    - max_merge_invocations: The maximum number of merge invocations to perform.
    - merge_val_overlap_floor: Minimum number of shared validation ids required between parents before attempting a merge subsample. Only relevant when using `val_evaluation_policy` other than `full_eval`.

    # Budget and Stop Condition
    - max_metric_calls: Optional maximum number of metric calls to perform. If not provided, stop_callbacks must be provided.
    - stop_callbacks: Optional stopper(s) that return True when optimization should stop. Can be a single StopperProtocol or a list or tuple of StopperProtocol instances. Examples: FileStopper, TimeoutStopCondition, SignalStopper, NoImprovementStopper, or custom stopping logic. If not provided, max_metric_calls must be provided.

    # Logging and Callbacks
    - logger: A `LoggerProtocol` instance that is used to log the progress of the optimization.
    - callbacks: Optional list of callback objects for observing optimization progress. Callbacks receive events like on_optimization_start, on_iteration_start, on_candidate_accepted, etc. See `gepa.core.callbacks.GEPACallback` for the full protocol.
    - run_dir: The directory to save the results to. Optimization state and results will be saved to this directory. If the directory already exists, GEPA will read the state from this directory and resume the optimization from the last saved state. Three-role strategies also persist `reflection-run-contract.json` and reject resume when their template, Controller policy, semantic catalog, operator basis, or execution bounds drift. If provided, a FileStopper is automatically created which checks for the presence of "gepa.stop" in this directory, allowing graceful stopping of the optimization process upon its presence.
    - use_wandb: Whether to use Weights and Biases to log the progress of the optimization.
    - wandb_api_key: The API key to use for Weights and Biases.
    - wandb_init_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the Weights and Biases initialization.
    - wandb_attach_existing: When True, log into the already-active W&B run without calling wandb.init() or wandb.finish(). Use when GEPA is embedded in a training loop that owns the run.
    - mlflow_attach_existing: When True, log into the already-active MLflow run without calling mlflow.start_run() or mlflow.end_run(). Use when GEPA is embedded in a training loop that owns the run.
    - use_mlflow: Whether to use MLflow to log the progress of the optimization.
      Both wandb and mlflow can be used simultaneously if desired.
    - mlflow_tracking_uri: The tracking URI to use for MLflow.
    - mlflow_experiment_name: The experiment name to use for MLflow.
    - track_best_outputs: Whether to track the best outputs on the validation set. If True, GEPAResult will contain the best outputs obtained for each task in the validation set.
    - display_progress_bar: Show a tqdm progress bar over metric calls when enabled.
    - use_cloudpickle: Use cloudpickle instead of pickle. This can be helpful when the serialized state contains dynamically generated DSPy signatures.
    - write_agent_state: When True, write an agent-readable directory tree under `run_dir` alongside `gepa_state.bin` (`iterations/<id>/` + `pareto/`). Each loop iteration gets its own subdir (accepted or rejected) with `meta.json`, `components/`, `trace.json` (before/after scores + trajectories); accepted ones also get `val_scores.json`, `outputs/`, `trajectories/`. Seed is `iterations/seed/`. Default False; turn on when an agent (e.g. Claude Code) will read the run directory.

    # Evaluation caching
    - cache_evaluation: Whether to cache the (score, output, objective_scores) of (candidate, example) pairs. If True and a cache entry exists, GEPA will skip the fitness evaluation and use the cached results. This helps avoid redundant evaluations and saves metric calls. Defaults to False.

    # Reproducibility
    - seed: The seed to use for the random number generator.
    - val_evaluation_policy: Strategy controlling which validation ids to score each iteration and which candidate is currently best. Supported strings: "full_eval" (evaluate every id each time) Passing None defaults to "full_eval".
    - raise_on_exception: Whether to propagate proposer/evaluator exceptions instead of stopping gracefully.
