class GEPAAdapter(Protocol[DataInst, Trajectory, RolloutOutput]):
    """
    GEPAAdapter is the single integration point between your system
    and the GEPA optimization engine. Implementers provide three responsibilities:

    The following are user-defined types that are not interpreted by GEPA but are used by the user's code
        to define the adapter:
    DataInst: User-defined type of input data to the program under optimization.
    Trajectory: User-defined type of trajectory data, which typically captures the
        different steps of the program candidate execution.
    RolloutOutput: User-defined type of output data from the program candidate.

    The following are the responsibilities of the adapter:
    1) Program construction and evaluation (evaluate):
       Given a batch of DataInst and a "candidate" program (mapping from named components
       -> component text), execute the program to produce per-example scores and
       optionally rich trajectories (capturing intermediate states) needed for reflection.

    2) Reflective dataset construction (make_reflective_dataset):
       Given the candidate, EvaluationBatch (trajectories, outputs, scores), and the list of components to update,
       produce a small JSON-serializable dataset for each component that you want to update. This
       dataset is fed to the teacher LM to propose improved component text.

    3) Optional instruction proposal (propose_new_texts):
       GEPA provides a default implementation (instruction_proposal.py) that serializes the reflective dataset
       to propose new component texts. However, users can implement their own proposal logic by implementing this method.
       This method receives the current candidate, the reflective dataset, and the list of components to update,
       and returns a mapping from component name to new component text.

    4) Optional adapter state persistence (get_adapter_state / set_adapter_state):
       Adapters that need to persist state across checkpoint save/load/resume
       boundaries can implement two optional methods:

       - ``get_adapter_state() -> dict[str, Any]``: return a fresh dict of
         adapter-specific state to be snapshotted into the checkpoint. Must
         return a **new dict** (not a reference to internal state) to avoid
         mutations between snapshot and save.
       - ``set_adapter_state(state: dict[str, Any]) -> None``: restore
         previously persisted state into the adapter (called on resume).

       Adapters that do not implement these methods are unaffected — the
       engine detects their absence via duck typing and skips the calls.

    Key concepts and contracts:
    - candidate: Dict[str, str] mapping a named component of the system to its corresponding text.
    - scores: higher is better. GEPA uses:
      - minibatch: sum(scores) to compare old vs. new candidate (acceptance test),
      - full valset: mean(scores) for tracking and Pareto-front selection.
      Ensure your metric is calibrated accordingly or normalized to a consistent scale.
    - trajectories: opaque to GEPA (the engine never inspects them). They must be
      consumable by your own make_reflective_dataset implementation to extract the
      minimal context needed to produce meaningful feedback for every component of
      the system under optimization.
    - error handling: Never raise for individual example failures. Instead:
      - Return a valid `EvaluationBatch` with per-example failure scores (e.g., 0.0)
        when formatting/parsing fails. Even better if the trajectories are also populated
        with the failed example, including the error message, identifying the reason for the failure.
      - Reserve exceptions for unrecoverable, systemic failures (e.g., missing model,
        misconfigured program, schema mismatch).
      - If an exception is raised, the engine will log the error and proceed to the next iteration.

        Run the program defined by `candidate` on a batch of data.

        Parameters
        - batch: list of task-specific inputs (DataInst).
        - candidate: mapping from component name -> component text. You must instantiate
          your full system with the component text for each component, and execute it on the batch.
        - capture_traces: when True, you must populate `EvaluationBatch.trajectories`
          with a per-example trajectory object that your `make_reflective_dataset` can
          later consume. When False, you may set trajectories=None to save time/memory.
          capture_traces=True is used by the reflective mutation proposer to build a reflective dataset.

        Returns
        - EvaluationBatch with:
          - outputs: raw per-example outputs (opaque to GEPA).
          - scores: per-example floats, length == len(batch). Higher is better.
          - trajectories:
              - if capture_traces=True: list[Trajectory] with length == len(batch).
              - if capture_traces=False: None.

        Scoring semantics
        - The engine uses sum(scores) on minibatches to decide whether to accept a
          candidate mutation and average(scores) over the full valset for tracking.
        - Prefer to return per-example scores, that can be aggregated via summation.
        - If an example fails (e.g., parse error), use a fallback score (e.g., 0.0).

        Correctness constraints
        - len(outputs) == len(scores) == len(batch)
        - If capture_traces=True: trajectories must be provided and len(trajectories) == len(batch)
        - Do not mutate `batch` or `candidate` in-place. Construct a fresh program

          Each record should be JSON-serializable and is passed verbatim to the
